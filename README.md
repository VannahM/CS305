# CS305

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
The client is a company that offers online financial services to its customers. They reached out for help with improving the security of their web application as they were concerned about potential vulnerabilities that could put sensitive financial and personal data at risk. Their main goal was to ensure that the application was secure, reliable, and compliant with industry standards to protect user information and maintain customer trust.

•	What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I did a good job spotting the main security issues in the code, like weak logins and spots where hackers could mess with the database. I also explained how to fix them in a clear, simple way. Writing secure code is important because it keeps user info safe and helps prevent hacks or data leaks. For a company like Artemis Financial strong security builds trust with customers and helps avoid big problems down the line. It is a key part of keeping the business running smoothly and safely.

•	Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was using security scanning tools like OWASP. They made it much easier to spot common vulnerabilities and gave me a clear starting point for where to focus my attention. It was also helpful to see how small changes in the code could make a big difference in security. This experience taught me how to systematically approach security issues, which will definitely help in future projects.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security I implemented measures like input validation. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP to scan for vulnerabilities. I would assess the risks by looking at things like potential data loss or system downtime then decide on the best mitigation techniques based on the severity of each issue and the system’s needs.

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I scanned the code for vulnerabilities and performed thorough testing to ensure it was both functional and secure. After making changes to the code I retested everything to make sure no new issues were introduced and that the application still worked as expected.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
For this project, I used tools like OWASP for security scanning. I also followed coding practices like input validation. These resources and practices will definitely be helpful in future tasks as they’ll help me write cleaner, safer code and catch security issues early in the development process.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
For future employers I would show my vulnerability assessment report which highlights the security issues I identified and the steps I took to fix them. I would also share examples of the refactored code showing how I improved security and functionality. I could demonstrate the testing results that prove the software is both secure and works as expected. This would give potential employers a clear picture of my ability to identify issues, implement solutions, and ensure high-quality code.
